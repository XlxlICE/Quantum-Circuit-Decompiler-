# Quantum-Circuit-Decompiler-
Circuit decompilation entails the reverse engineering of digital logic circuits to reconstitute a high-level representation
that approximates the original design, usually articulated in hardware description languages. In this project, we will
explore methods to implement quantum circuit decompilation, focusing specifically on inferring shared structures in
a set of circuits. The high-level compressed description of this set of circuits of an algorithm would then be used
to generate circuits of new problem sizes to test the generalization capability of the abstracted explanation. The
decompiler will be tested on algorithm-generated quantum circuits and hardware-optimized versions of these circuits
to investigate the explainability-efficiency trade-off.
